RefOS
=====

RefOS is a sample implementation of a simple multi-server OS on seL4.

The aim of RefOS is to:

* Provide reference design of a simple multi-server OS protocol on seL4.
* Provide a sample implementation of the protocol.
* Simplify development & porting of userland programs.
* Serve as an example codebase to start new component-based seL4 projects.

#### Features

* Simple and light-weight OS.
* Multi-server component based OS design.
* Process & thread abstraction.
* Dataspace abstraction.
* Shared memory support.
* Dynamic mmap and sbrk support.
* User-land serial & timer drivers.
* Well documented, Doxygen supported.

**NOTE:** Please note that RefOS is intended to be only an example system, a work-in-progress, and is not to be
deployed as a real OS solution. RefOS is not verified, not high assurance, and may not be optimised for speed and
efficiency, and may be missing most of the features you'll expect in a deployable OS environment.

### Quick Start

#### Building RefOS

In order to build the RefOS implementation codebase:

0. Read: http://sel4.systems/Download/. Set up the environment (repo tool, cross compilers...etc) as per the 
   instructions on the page.

1. > git clone https://github.com/gapry/refos.git

2. Install the following packages (package named based on Ubuntu 14.04):
  > sudo apt-get install python-tempita

3. > make help (to list the configs)

4. > make \<config\>

   > make silentoldconfig

   Where <config> is one of the configurations listed with the above command,
   eg. make kzm\_debug\_test\_defconfig

5. > make

  If all goes well you should now have a bootable system image (refos/images/refos-image).

6. > make simulate-kzm

  Look under http://sel4.systems/Download/ section "Simulating the result".


#### Building Design Document

Note that the design document has not been finished yet, and is still a work-in-progress. Thus, some
details may slightly differ between the design document and the implementation.

In order to build the design document PDF file:

1. Clone the repository (see above, Building RefOS).

3. Install the following packages (package named based on Ubuntu 14.04):
  > sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base mscgen texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-recommended

4. > make design

   This should give you a path to the paper.pdf document.
   

#### Building Doxygen Code Documentation

1. Clone the repository (see above, Building RefOS).

2. Install the following packages (package named based on Ubuntu 14.04):
  > sudo apt-get install doxygen

3. > cd docs/

4. > make
