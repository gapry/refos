        Port of libvterm by Paul "LeoNerd" Evans, a C99 virtual terminal emulator library released
        under the MIT license. As the library uses abstract C99 with no dependance on any POSIX or
        any rendering / UI system, no changes to the library code was required; only the build
        system has been adapted.
