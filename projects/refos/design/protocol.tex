\section{Message Sequences}

This section will provide a series of example message sequences for common tasks, using the protocol
interfaces described.

\subsection{Server registration}

\autoref{f:servreg} illustrates the protocol a server uses to register itself under a name.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\begin{msc}
msc {
    hscale = "1.5";

    R [ label ="Name Server"],
    S [ label = "Data Server"];
    
    S box S [ label = "create badged endpoint cap dataserv\_anon\_C"];
 
    S => R [ label = "nameserv\_session\_C.register(\"server\_name\", dataserv\_anon\_C)"];
    R box R [ label = "handle request, register under given name"];
    R >> S [ label = "ErrorCode"];
}
\end{msc}
\end{center}
\caption{Server registration.}
\label{f:servreg}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Establish a session to a server}


\autoref{f:estab} illustrates that to interact with a server, one must establish a session with it
through its anonymous endpoint cap. The end state after establishment should be an established
session to the server represented by a \obj{session} cap, with the server knowing the security
subject of the client, and optionally death notification set up so the server knows when the
client exits and can clean up book-keeping after it.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{msc}
      msc {
        hscale = "1.5";

        R [ label ="Process Server"],
        F [ label = "File Server"],
        C [ label = "Client"],
        N [ label ="Name Server"];

        R:>C [ label = "procserv\_liveness\_C"];
        C box C [label = "loop until path fully resolved:"];
        C=>N [ label = "nameserv\_session\_C.resolve\_segment(\"dataserver\")"];
        N>>C [ label = "(ErrorCode, dataserv\_anon\_C)"];
        C=>F [ label = "dataserv\_anon\_C.connect(procserv\_liveness\_C)"];
        F box F [label = "handle request, create client"];
        F=>R [ label = "procserv\_session\_C.watch\_client(procserv\_liveness\_C)"];
        R box R [ label = "set up death notify"];
        R>>F [ label = "(ErrorCode, death\_id, principle\_id)"];
        F box F [ label = "create session cap for new client"];
        F>>C [ label = "(dataserv\_session\_C)"];
      }
    \end{msc}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Example message sequence for finding \& establishing connection with a server.}
  \label{f:estab}
\end{figure}

Note the (optional) principle\_id is intended to be used for authentication assuming
ACL-like security model in the file system.

\subsection{Opening and closing a Dataspace}

\autoref{f:openclose} show a sample where a client opens a dataspace which
could subsequently be used for mapping in a window. After use, it can be
closed.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{msc}
      msc {
        hscale = "1.5";

        D [ label = "Data Server"],
        C [ label = "Client"];

        C=>D [ label = "dataserv\_session\_C.open(name, flags, mode, size)"];
        D box D [label = "handle request, create dataspace"];
        D>>C [ label = "(ErrorCode, dataserv\_dataspace\_C)"];
        C box C [label="read/write/share/use dataspace"];
        C=>D [label = "dataserv\_session\_C.close(dataserv\_session\_C)"];
        D>>C [label = "ErrorCode" ];
      }
    \end{msc}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Sample protocol for opening and closing a dataspace.}
  \label{f:openclose}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Map Dataspace in a window}

\autoref{f:opendata} shows mapping an open dataspace into a given memory window.  The initialisation
part sets up the basic components for sample fault delegation in the system.  Note that the process
server is acting as the memory manager here in this example, as is in our simple implementation. The
paging could instead go through a separate memory manager process.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{msc}
      msc {
        hscale = "1.5";

        R [ label = "Process Server"],
        P [ label = "Data Server"],
        C [ label = "Client"];

        C abox P [ label = "Create a dataspace" ];
        C=>R [ label = "procserv\_session\_C.create\_mem\_window(base, size, perms, flags)"];
        R>>C [ label = "(ErrorCode, procserv\_window\_C)"];
        C=>P [ label = "dataserv\_session\_C.datamap(dataserv\_dataspace\_C, procserv\_window\_C, offset)"];
        P box P [label = "validate request"];
        P=>R [ label = "procserv\_session\_C.register\_as\_pager(procserv\_window\_C, dataserv\_notify\_C)"];
        R box R [ label = "book-keep pager information"];
        R>>P [ label = "(ErrorCode, window\_id)"];
        P>>C [ label = "ErrorCode"];
      }
    \end{msc}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Sample protocol for mapping a dataspace into a given window.}
  \label{f:opendata}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Page Fault}

\autoref{f:pagefault} show the page fault resolution protocol in the case of an external dataspace
server backing a window in the client's address space. In our implementation, the \seLf microkernel
sends the page fault notification to an endpoint cap pretending to be the faulting process.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{msc}
      msc {
        hscale = "1.5";
        
        K [ label ="Kernel"],
        P [ label ="Process Server"],
        C [ label = "Client"],
        D [ label = "Data Server"];
       
        C box C [label = "VM fault into mapped dataspace"];
        K->P [label = "Page fault notification"];
        P box P [label = "transform fault into window\_id, offset"];
        P->D [ label = "dataserv\_event\_C.pagefault\_notify(window\_id,offset,op)"];
        D=>P [ label = "procserv\_session\_C.window\_map(window\_cap, window\_offset, src\_addr)"];
        P box P [ label = "handle request and find frame"];
        P:>C [ label = "map\_frame(frame)"];
        P>>D [ label = "ErrorCode"];
        P:>C [ label = "Resume execution"];
      }
    \end{msc}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Page fault protocol.}
  \label{f:pagefault}
\end{figure}

\clearpage
\subsection{Death notification}
\autoref{f:deathnotify} illustrates an example message sequence for death notification. Note that
it is assumed that the client is active and has already established connection with the data server
(see \autoref{f:estab}), and that the data server has since then set up death notification.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\begin{msc}
  msc {
    hscale = "1.5";

    C [ label = "Client"],
    P [ label = "Process Server"],
    D [ label = "Data Server"];
    
    C box C [ label = "Exits program" ];
    C => P [ label = "procserv\_session\_C.exit(status)" ];
    P box P [ label = "Delete client process" ];
    P >> D [ label = "dataserv\_event\_C.death\_notify(death\_id)" ];
    D box D [ label = "Delete client session book-keeping" ];
  }
\end{msc}
\end{center}
\caption{Example death notification.}
\label{f:deathnotify}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Dataspace Sharing}

\autoref{f:sharedata} is an example of how to set up a shared dataspace. Note that the assumption is
that the share is not revocable and that sharing is with someone who is trusted. So given two
clients, one must trust the other, or both must trust the other. Mutual distrust is not supported
yet simply as cap transfer to an untrusted entity requires more than a direct call.

Dataspace sharing is used to implement 

In this example, the shared dataspace is implemented by the process server (acting as the memory
manager), and is shared with a server. This is would be typical for a shared memory communication
buffer.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{msc}
      msc {
        hscale = "1.5";

        R [ label ="Process Server"],
        C [ label = "Client"],
        D [ label = "Server"];
        
        C=>R [ label = "procserv\_session\_C.open(\"anon\", flags, mode, size)"];
        R>>C [ label = "(ErrorCode, procserv\_dataspace\_C)"];
        --- [ label = "Client maps the dataspace" ];
        C=>R [ label = "procserv\_process\_C.create\_mem\_window(base, size, perm, flags)"];
        R>>C [ label = "(ErrorCode, procserv\_window\_C)"];
        C=>R [ label = "procserv\_session\_C.datamap(procserv\_dataspace\_C, procserv\_window\_C, offset)"];
        R>>C [ label = "ErrorCode"];
        --- [ label = "Share to dataspace cap with server"];
        C=>D [ label = "serv\_session\_C.datashare(procserv\_dataspace\_C)"];
        D=>R [ label = "procserv\_process\_C.Create\_mem\_window(base, flags, mode, size)"];
        R>>D [ label = "(ErrorCode, procserv\_window2\_C)"];
        D=>R [ label = "procserv\_session\_C.datamap(procserv\_dataspace\_C, procserv\_window2\_C, offset)"];
        R>>D [ label = "ErrorCode"];
        D>>C [ label = "ErrorCode"];
        D abox C [ label = "Communicate using shared dataspace." ];
      }
    \end{msc}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Sample protocol for sharing an anonymous dataspace.}
  \label{f:sharedata}
\end{figure}

\clearpage

In the \autoref{f:sharedatathird} example, the dataspace is implemented not by the process server,
but instead an external data server. Thus, a third party is involved in this case. This is a more
general example of \autoref{f:sharedata}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{msc}
      msc {
        hscale = "1.5";

        R [ label ="Process Server"],
        D [ label = "Data Server"],
        CA [ label = "Client A"],
        CB [ label = "Client B"];
        
        CA=>D [ label = "dataserv\_session\_C.open(\"filename\", flags, mode, size)"];
        D>>CA [ label = "(ErrorCode, dataserv\_dataspace\_C)"];

        --- [ label = "Client A maps the dataspace" ];
        CA=>R [ label = "procserv\_session\_C.create\_mem\_window(base, size, perm, flags)"];
        R>>CA [ label = "(ErrorCode, procserv\_window\_C)"];
        CA=>D [ label = "dataserv\_session\_C.datamap(dataserv\_dataspace\_C, procserv\_window\_C, offset)"];
        D=>R [ label = "procserv\_session\_C.register\_as\_pager(procserv\_window\_C, dataserv\_notify\_C)"];
        R box R [ label = "Book-keep pager information"];
        R>>D [ label = "(ErrorCode, window\_id)"];
        D>>CA [ label = "ErrorCode"];

        --- [ label = "Now share the dataspace with client B"];
        CA=>CB [ label = "clientB\_session\_C.datashare(dataserv\_dataspace\_C)"];

        --- [ label = "Client B also maps the dataspace"];
        CB=>R [ label = "procserv\_session\_C.create\_mem\_window(base, size, perm, flags)"];
        R>>CB [ label = "(ErrorCode, procserv\_window2\_C)"];
        CB=>D [ label = "dataserv\_session\_C.datamap(dataserv\_dataspace\_C, procserv\_window2\_C, offset)"];
        D=>R [ label = "procserv\_session\_C.register\_as\_pager(procserv\_window2\_C, dataserv\_notify\_C)"];
        R box R [ label = "Book-keep pager information"];
        R>>D [ label = "(ErrorCode, window\_id)"];
        D>>CB [ label = "ErrorCode"];

        --- [ label = "Both clients have dataspace mapped"];
        CA abox CB [ label = "Communicate using shared dataspace." ];
      }
    \end{msc}

\subsection{Content Initialise a Dataspace with Another Dataspace}

\autoref{f:initdata} shows creating a dataspace and setting it so that it is initialised by the
content of another. Out example initialises a RAM dataspace (with the process server acting as its
data server, as per our implementation) with the contents of an executable file from another
dataspace.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{msc}
      msc {
        hscale = "1.5";

        P [ label ="Process Server"],
        D [ label = "Data Server"],
        C [ label = "Client"];

        --- [ label = "Open the dataspace to be initialised"];
        C=>P [ label = "proc\_session\_C.open(\"anon\", flags, mode, size)"];
        P>>C [ label = "(ErrorCode, procserv\_dataspace\_C)"];

        P>>D [ label = "(ErrorCode, data\_id)"];
        D>>C [ label = "ErrorCode"];

        C=>P [ label = "procserv\_process\_C.create\_mem\_window(base, size, perm, flags)"];
        P>>C [ label = "(ErrorCode, procserv\_window\_C)"];
        C=>P [ label = "procserv\_session\_C.datamap(procserv\_dataspace\_C, procserv\_window\_C, offset)"];
        P>>C [ label = "ErrorCode"];

        C box C [ label = "Read from content-initialised mapped dataspace"];
      }

\subsection{Content Initialisated Page Fault}

\autoref{f:initfault} show the page fault resolution protocol in the case of an external dataspace
server providing the initial data for the dataspace. Note the similarity with \autoref{f:pagefault};
although different in concept, these two are similar in nature and may share a lot in
implementation. The subtle yet importance difference between the two is that for
\texttt{provide\_data} the content in the given frame is only read but not used; it is read and
copied to the receiving dataserver's own dataspace. This is in contrast to \texttt{window\_map}
which actually uses the given frame and maps the same physical frame into the client's address space
to resolve the fault.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{msc}
      msc {
        hscale = "1.5";

        P box P [label = "transform fault into window\_id, offset"];
        P->D [ label = "dataserv\_event\_C.initfault\_notify(data\_id, offset)"];
        D=>P [ label = "procserv\_session\_C.provide\_data(data\_id, src\_addr, offset)"];
        P box P [ label = "validate and find frame and copy data"];
        P:>C [ label = "map\_frame(frame)"];
        P>>D [ label = "ErrorCode"];

\subsection{ELF loading}

\autoref{f:elfloading} shows the elf loading protocol for bootstrapping a user process.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{msc}
      msc {
        hscale = "1.5";

\section{Data Structures}

This section will provide a series of example data structures for \refOS. These are only meant to be
a guideline, and will be presented in the C language. The data structures here aim to be the minimal
information such a structure should store, for a rough idea of what these objects represent.
Implementations may need to add extra members and references to these data structures to make
internal book-keeping easier.

\subsection {Memory window}

A window should book-keeps its state, which vspace it belongs to, where and how long the segment is,
and the state of its contents. A window my be unmapped, or mapped to a dataspace (and that dataspace
may be content initialised). In our implementation, the process server was also the anonymous
memory dataserver, so this window structure has extra book-keeping for internal anonymous dataspace
mapping state. Also, our implementation separated offset + size from a window.

\begin{verbatim}
struct w_window {
    vspace_t *vspace;
    vaddr_t offset;
    vaddr_t size;
    uint32_t permissions;
    bool cacheable;
    cspacepath_t capability;
    pager_t pager;
};
\end{verbatim}

\subsection {Process control block}

A process structure should book-keep its address space (capability space and virtual memory space),
its threads, and clients is it watching. In our implementation we also added parameter buffers,
notification ring buffers, process' OS system capabilities bitmask, parent, debug name, and so
forth.

\begin{verbatim}
struct proc_pcb {
    struct vs_vspace vspace;
    proc_tcb threads[];
    struct proc_watch_list clientWatchList;
};
\end{verbatim}

\subsection {Anonymous dataspace}

An anonymous dataspace would need to book keep its capability, list of frame pages it is
representing, and the content initialisation data. The content initialisation bitmask keeps which
pages in the dataspace have been initialised, and which still need to be initialised. Initialisation
happens lazily, on the first VM fault, so a waiting list of clients that are VM fault blocked
waiting for content to be initialised needs to be kept.

\begin{verbatim}
struct ram_dspace {
    cspacepath_t capability;
    vka_object_t *pages;
    uint32_t npages;
    cspacepath_t contentInitEP;
    uint32_t *contentInitBitmask;
    cvector_t contentInitWaitingList;
};
\end{verbatim}

\subsection {Archived file server dataspace}

This dataspace assumes that there is a char* storing the file data somewhere in the process server's
address space. In our implementation this came from a CPIO format archive linked into the process's
ELF sections.

\begin{verbatim}
struct fs_dataspace {
    seL4_CPtr dataspaceCap;
    seL4_Word permissions;
    char *fileData;
    size_t fileDataSize;
    content_init_info_t contentInitInfo;
};
\end{verbatim}

\subsection {Userland dataspace mapping}

This is the example data structure for a userland dataspace mapping. The window, dataspace, and
session are book-kept, along with the virtual address and size of the window segment.

\begin{verbatim}
typedef struct data_mapping {
    seL4_CPtr session;
    seL4_CPtr dataspace;
    seL4_CPtr window;
    char* vaddr;
    int windowSize;
    int dspaceSize;
} data_mapping_t;
\end{verbatim}
