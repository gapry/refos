        When set to true will mark generated functions as 'inline', allowing
        them to be inlined by the callee user code. This may be undesirable
        for verification, so setting to 'n' will forcively prevent the function
        from being inlined

        Generate the 'WithMRs' variants of the syscall stubs. These stubs
        avoid the use of the IPC buffer where possible and attempt to
        place syscall arguments directly into and out of cpu registers.
        GCC's register allocation is a hint only and cannot be relied upon,
        as a result these stubs are known to be broken, and are disabled,
        at -O0

        When generating syscall wrappers, only use the IPC buffer for
        marshalling and unmarshalling arguments. Without this option set,
        arguments will be passed in registers where possible for better
        performance.
